+ Project summary: Donald J. Trump is the current President of the United States since January 2017. However, before the President election Trump is only well known for his wealth and success in business. For example, according to Forbes, Trump was the 544th richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion dollars as of 2017. Interestingly, although Trump had few political experience before the election, he beated his main opponent Hillary Clinton who is a famous politician and the wife of Bill Clinton. Thus, the question is how did Donald "trump" Hillary in the general election?
